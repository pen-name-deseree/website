<h1>Into The Abyss of Madness and Chaos</h1>  
<br/>
 <p> 
Selena Bright. Daughter of the most powerful sorceress, with Lycan blood running through her veins.
Her gift of magic was sealed by her mother before she was sent to the human realm since the night she was born to keep her safe and away from the grasp of the enemies.
A young lady with the wits and strength of her Lycan father; and inherited the immense arcane of her mother, which could create magic beyond the grasp of any spell 
casters. A young sorceress, who has Madness and Chaos inside her. Acclaimed by the Elder Witch to be the redeemer of the Lost City of Arcan, to return the balance 
in the four magical realms. Desired by the Vampire Lord. Marked by the Alpha King. And a Princess next in line to be Queen. But the question is, does she want any of 
that? And with her heart acting up, could she be able to fulfill the great responsibility that was put on her shoulder since she was an innocent child? Or would it be 
easier for her to just give up rather than continue playing the superhero, who couldnâ€™t even save her heart from its own despair?

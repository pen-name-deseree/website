 I fell in love with writing since I was in high school. It was only mid of 2021 when I decided to pursue writing as my career.
 And since then waking up at 3 am has become my thing. My usual routine is, I’ll grab a cup of coffee, and face my computer right away, 
 to start my day, then put my thoughts into text. And the moment I start typing the very first word in my head, I am quickly 
 thrown into another world that only I knew existed. But don’t get me wrong, I am a writer, so maybe having my own world is just a normal thing. 
 Being a writer is both my dream and choice. But aside from that, I also enjoy many things such as biking, playing with RC cars; 
 playing with my six dogs who are literally with me 24/7, and believe me when I say being with them all day long could be annoying and thrilling 
 at the same time. However, the joy I get from them, and the love they give me in return, are immeasurable. Not to mention we at home all love to eat. 
 That’s why cooking is one of my many guilty pleasures. Oh, did I just say cooking? Perhaps I am hungry again.

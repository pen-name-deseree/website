Waking up at 3 am became my thing since I started writing. Then, I’ll grab a cup of coffee, and face my computer to start my day, 
 then put my thoughts into text. And the moment I start typing the very first word in my head, I am quickly thrown into another world that 
 only I knew existed. But don’t get me wrong, I am a writer, so maybe having my own world is just a normal thing.  
 Being a writer is both my dream and choice. But aside from it, I also enjoy many things such as playing RC cars;
 playing with my six dogs who were literally with me 24/7 and believe me when I say being with them all day long could 
 be annoying and thrilling at the same time. However, the joy I get from them, and the love they give me in return, 
 are incomparable. Not to mention we at home all love to eat. That’s why cooking is one of my many guilty pleasures. 
 Oh, did I just say cooking? Perhaps I am hungry again.</p>

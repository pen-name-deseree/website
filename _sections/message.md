If you want to live your dream, you need two things; your dream, and you, making that dream come true. And in my case, it almost took me forever before I realized what really is my dream and where I really wanted to take my life moving forward.  

I am the second eldest of five siblings, and we were raised by our mother all on her own since our father died when I was seven years old. I grew up in one of the poorest neighborhoods in Metro Manila. And I never would have thought that I would ever get the chance to leave that place. Not that I am ashamed of my roots, but rather, I am afraid of what I will become when I stayed there; as the neighborhood, I grew up in was very good at shattering one’s dream, with no one realizing it.  

It was during my early 20s when I realize I was killing my own future because everything around me was stopping me from spreading my wings to fly and reach my dream. However, someone made me realize that my life wasn’t a dead end; that I still have a chance to recourse my life to where I wanted it to go. That I could still achieve everything I wanted to have in life. All I need is one, myself; two, cracked and took out the hard-coded bad habits I have in me, and lastly, I have to capitalize on myself, but believe me, when I say “capitalizing on yourself” it’s not all about the money.  

And I could never forget the very words that struck me to the core, “If you want something, don’t just want it. But want it so bad that you became obsessed with it.”
At first, I was confused. I don’t understand how I could ever do that? I mean, how could I ever recourse my life into something great? Something that I could be proud of.  

And in the course of my finding the answer to that, which had literally turned into a riddle in my head, I met one of my darkest points in life. That even though I have these people who cared so much about me, I still feel all alone. I felt like I had met the end of my life — the end of my journey. I felt so hopeless and helpless.  

Then I tried to look deeper into myself, and a sudden thought hit me, “I wanted to write something, a poem, a story, my biography, anything related to writing.”
I got excited. For the first time being trapped in the dark, I realized I wanted to write. Then another thought hit me — hey, I was already doing that since I was in high school, and ever since then I already wanted to be a writer, but since there was no money in writing, I killed the idea; I have killed my dream.  

However, after so many days of just sulking in the room, mulling about one of my biggest dreams of mine that I pushed aside because of so many excuses and apprehensions I have in my head, I suddenly thought to myself why not I give it a chance. Besides, I have nothing to lose if I try.  

And frankly speaking, deciding to give my writing dream a chance was one of the best decisions I had made in my life. Now, I am not just enjoying writing my thoughts and putting them together to make novels in the comfort of my home. It could also put food on the table and could take me to places. And not just that, as I also find the purpose I have been looking for all my life. And I finally understand what “If you want something, don’t just want it. But want it so bad that you became obsessed with it” means.  

So if you wanted to live your dream, don’t just dream, do something. Be obsessed with your dream.

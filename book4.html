   <h1>The WereWolfe Empire:  
    “A Howlin’ Heir”</h1>
   <br/>
 <p>
A curse was invoked by a God, as a punishment for the gruesome deeds of a man—Lycaon. The first man cursed to be a werewolf.
His curse was inherited by his descendants. And Salvatore Wolfe is the last living one.
Living for over three centuries claiming almost half of the land in the world, killing people one after another or even hunting them down to eat them alive when the Bloodlust Beast inside of him resurfaces every full moon, seizing control of his consciousness while taking away all his goodness. Leaving bloodbath aftermath. A gruesome deed. An act so evil that even the devil himself wouldn’t dare to do.
He wanted it to end. But the curse he has, couldn’t simply make him dead.
His curse is forever.
However, one fateful night and an act of kindness.
Kindness that the receiver, a young Theo Williams, wants to return in however way possible.
Is a simple act of kindness being shown to Theo, enough to offer himself to be Salvatore’s salvation from his curse?
And in the course of Theo accepting everything; Salvatore Wolfe’s Empire, wealth, and his curse — Penny Young happens.
The Ms. Goody two shoes Theo didn’t expect himself to fall in love with.
A werewolf curse, a love he couldn’t have and a long life he’s preparing to live all on his own.
It all starts with an act of kindness. But it all turned his life upside-down.
It turned him into a howlin’ heir that he wished he had never become.

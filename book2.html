<h1>KRIZZA: The Billionaire’s Unfinished Business</h1>  
 <br/>
 <p>
The heart wants what the heart wants, they said — but, who said that anyway? Luis Maximus San Diego, Max for short, is a desirable man. With his looks, money, and 
wits he’ll surely make any woman fall on their knees. But for him, a woman is just someone to warm his bed, or at least it is. His confidence fits him like a second 
skin. He is the creator of his reality and a man that knows no boundaries. In business he is gutsy. At a young age, he took over their company because his parents 
decided to retire early. One day, when he visits his parents, he meets the most remarkable and unforgettable woman he has ever laid his eyes on, Krizza. She has a 
striking beauty with a curvaceous body and a captivating personality that any man would die for. But here’s the catch, they just met once, and that’s the beginning and 
end of it. Since then, he considered her as his unfinished business. Seven years later… “My heart wants her, and only her, or else it does not care. Not an ounce.”
What will happen if Krizza and Max meet in a very unexpected way again? Will the two of them succumb to both their pent-up desires for each other or will they let fate 
dictate their destiny one more time? And what if this time, someone wants to get in between them? Someone who wants Krizza to be his as well. Now, Krizza finds herself 
torn between two almost perfect lovers. Both have good looks that can make a woman’s heart melt and break. Both have empires. Both are Billionaires.
Who will she choose? The one from the past, or the one in the present. The man who holds her heart or the man who wants her heart.
